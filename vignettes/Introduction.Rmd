Introduction
----------------

ABSEIR is an R package designed to efficiently implement a class of spatial 
epidemic models known as spatial SEIR(S) models. This family of analytical 
techniques is more completely described in 
[this recently accepted manuscript](https://github.com/grantbrown/EARNMC/blob/master/manuscript-preprint/r0Methods.pdf),
as well as in [my thesis work](http://ir.uiowa.edu/etd/1554), though a brief practical introduction
is given here. 


Spatial SEIR Models
---------------------

If you're reading this, you're probably interested in epidemic modeling techniques.
It will therefore come as no surprise to you that epidemics develop
over both time and space. When we want to apply statistical models to these
phenomena, however, we need to be a bit more specific about what we mean when we
say 'time' and 'space'. The class of spatial SEIR(S) models is defined
for discrete time points and discrete spatial locations. This may take the form
of weekly reports on a particular disease process, perhaps subdivided by 
administrative regions. This specification stands in contrast to continuous spatiotemporal
processes, like the latitude, longitude, and time at which a biological sample is
taken.
