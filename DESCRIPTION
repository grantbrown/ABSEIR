Title: Posterior Approximation to Fully Bayesian Spatial SEIR Models Using the C
    ++ Actor Framework

Description: Approximate Bayesian Computing is a natural mechanism to accelerate
    the fitting of compartmental epidemic models. ABSEIR implements several such
    algorithms to fit a broad class of spatial and non-spatial SEIR and SEIRS
    epidemic models.
