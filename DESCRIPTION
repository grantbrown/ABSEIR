Title: Posterior Approximation to Fully Bayesian Spatial SEIR Models Using Multithreaded C++
Version: 1.3
Date: 2019-02-11
Author: Grant Brown
Maintainer: Grant Brown <grant-brown@uiowa.edu>
Description: Approximate Bayesian Computing is a natural mechanism to accelerate
    the fitting of compartmental epidemic models. ABSEIR implements several such
    algorithms to fit a broad class of spatial and non-spatial SEIR and SEIRS
    epidemic models.
